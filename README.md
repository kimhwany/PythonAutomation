## Weather App
Input the City where you want to see the weather and get the results back in real-time!

## Text To Speech
Using the python library gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) this script allows you to input the text that you want to convert into speech (MP3).

## Rock Paper Scissors
A simple Python script for playing Rock-Paper-Scissors against your computer!

## English --> "Yoda-english"
A fun script I saw and wanted to implement myself that converts an english sentence into how Yoda (from Star Wars) would say it!
